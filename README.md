# MakeMeLater
Created by Rachel Goodman (rgoodm2), Graham McAllister (gmcalllister3) and Shalini Sreedhar (shalini-s).
This was created during Emory's Hackathon on April 9th, 2016. HackEmory is a 1-day intensive Hackathon with a 20% acceptance rate.

We created a Google Chrome extension that allows to save recipes for use later. It also parses webpages.
